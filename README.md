Material for a background course on Logic and Type Theory. If you wish to start a REPL with the _scala_ code in this project, make sure JAVA 8 is installed and run

```bash
./mill -i logic.repl
```

The recommended way to browse the code is to install the _metals_ plugin in VS Code and open the folder. Alternatively, run
```bash
./mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
```

to set up the project for IntelliJ IDEA.
